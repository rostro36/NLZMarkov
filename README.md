# NLZMarkov
Markov chain based on articles of the "Neue Luzerner Zeitung".

## With two modes:
* one is a naive Markov chain that only depends on the previous words.
* the second is a part of speech enhanced variante, where the next word depends on the previous words and the type expected by the last given word.




## What possible to make better:
* the gui is not robust, because it doesn't use multithreading
* make custom errors for not being able to gather data.
